Hello, my name is Brandur, and this is my personal homepage/blog.

I live in Vesterbro, Copenhagen, with my wife Rosa and my son Ã˜rvur.

Currently I work as a cloud enginner at 'Udviklings-og Forkenklingsstyrelsen (UFST)' in Lyngby, Denmark.

I've got an M.Sc. eng. from The Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in mathematical modeling and computation. 
Before this I worked as an autodidact within Linux administration; mostly in the telecom business.

My interests include, but are not limited to: Guitar playing, online chess, and fitness.
